It took a few revisions, but the paper that originated as my master's dissertation —
_Certifiably Robust Variational Autoencoders_ ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07559))
— has been accepted as a full conference paper at
[AISTATS 2022](http://aistats.org/aistats2022/).

Grateful to all those who made this happen, not least my co-authors
[Alex](https://alexander-camuto.github.io/about/),
[Matthew](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/matthew-willetts) and
[Tom](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/).

Watch this space for a camera-ready version.
