Hi! I'm Ben.

I currently work at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing
quantitative solutions to problems in industry. Previously, I completed a master's
degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at
Harvard.

I'm looking to explore my interests in economics; broadly, I'd like to know more about
how we can intervene on economic systems to deliver both more efficient and more
equitable outcomes.

Outside of work, I care about modernist architecture, the outdoors, electronic music,
and good food.
