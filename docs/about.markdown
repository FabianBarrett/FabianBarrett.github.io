Hi! I'm Ben.

I currently work at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing
quantitative solutions to problems in industry. Previously, I completed a master's
degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at
Harvard.

I'm currently looking to explore my interests in economics -- broadly construed, I'd like
to know more about how we can intervene on economic systems to deliver more efficient
_and_ more equitable outcomes.

Outside of work, I care about some staples: architecture, the outdoors, electronic
music, and good food.
