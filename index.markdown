# About

Hi! I'm Ben.

I work at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing
quantitative solutions to problems in industry.

Previously, I completed a master's
degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at
Harvard.

I'm currently looking to explore interests in economics, in particular in areas like
market design and industrial organization.

Outside of work I get excited about architecture, the outdoors,
electronic music, and so much more.
