# About

Hi! :wave: I'm Ben.

I work at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing
quantitative solutions to problems in industry.

Previously, I completed a master's
degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at
Harvard.

I'm currently looking to explore interests in economics, in particular in areas like
market design and industrial organization.

I grew up in :fr:, :es: and :uk:, and have since also lived in :us: and :de:.
Outside of work, some of the things I get excited about are architecture, the outdoors,
and electronica.
