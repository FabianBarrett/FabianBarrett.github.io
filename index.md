<!-- ## About -->

Hi! :wave: I'm Ben.

I'm currently a predoctoral fellow in economics at the [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research](https://siepr.stanford.edu/), working with [Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/) and [Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/).

I'm broadly interested in industrial organization and empirical market design, with applications to environmental and health policy.

Previously, I was a data scientist at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), helping develop algorithmic pricing solutions. Before that, I completed a master's degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at Harvard.

I am applying to PhD programs in economics for Fall 2024 admission.
